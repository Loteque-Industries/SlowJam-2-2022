##Mechanics:
* The player is an alien catured by a seedy rouge orginization, they must escape using stealth, telepathathically controlling conversations, telekinetically solving puzzles, and telepathically explode heads!
* The main mechanic is sneaking around. When the player is hidden the arms will be translucent.
* When the player is "noticed" by another character a timer starts; that timer is visually indicated by the players arms filling up with opaque texture.
* The player character has special abilities they can use but only when they are *hidden*; if the player is discovered, when the timer runs out the ability terminates.
* **Telepathic Control**: 
	* The player can take over the mind of another character and talk to other characters nearby. In this mode the player can preselect dialouge or enter in arbitray text to have conversations to sway characters "moods" and make requests of nearby characters

	* The player activates the ability by moving the reticle over a characters head and toggles the interaction button. At this point the a halo surounds the characters head, it's size depends on the psycic resistance of the character. If the reticle moves outside that circle the possessed characters head explodes.

* **Telekinesis**:
	* The player character is able to pick up up to 4 small items telepathically. The player targets the item with the reticle presses the interaction button and the item begins to quickly move to the player characters hand. As the PC has 4 hands they can pick up 4 small items. 
	* The player character cannot use telepathy while using telekenisis as telepathy requires all four hands. 
	* While using telepathy, When the player is not targeting, they may press the action button two throw items in the direction of the reticle, releaseing items in the reverse order they were picked up.
